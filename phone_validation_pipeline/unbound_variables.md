The Pylance "possibly unbound variable" errors for current_row_scraper_status, current_row_verification_status, current_row_best_matched_numbers, current_row_other_relevant_numbers, and current_row_confidence_score in phone_validation_pipeline/main_pipeline.py are likely false positives. These variables are explicitly initialized at the beginning of the main try block (lines 239-243). Therefore, they are guaranteed to have a value if the corresponding except block is entered. Pylance's static analysis might be struggling with the complex control flow within the try block. The code is robust against runtime UnboundLocalError for these variables.
