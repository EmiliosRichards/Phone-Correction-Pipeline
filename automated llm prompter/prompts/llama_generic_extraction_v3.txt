TASK: Extract phone numbers from the following text.
OUTPUT FORMAT: You MUST provide your output as a JSON array. Each element in the array is a JSON object representing a single phone number. If no phone numbers are found, output an empty array: [].

Each JSON object MUST contain these exact fields, in this order:
1.  `original_number_text` (string): The phone number exactly as it appears in the text.
2.  `normalized_number` (string): The phone number in E.164 format (e.g., "+18005551234"). If country code is unknown, make a reasonable guess (e.g., assume US if format is typical for US numbers) and note this in `extra_details`. If E.164 is impossible, provide the most standard form.
3.  `category` (string): The category field MUST be one of the following exact string values:
    *   "Sales": Numbers explicitly mentioned for sales inquiries, product purchases, or business development.
    *   "Support": Numbers explicitly designated for customer service, helpdesk, or technical support.
    *   "Recruiting": Numbers related to recruitment or job applications.
    *   "General": General contact numbers or if the specific business purpose is unclear.
    *   "LowValue": Numbers that are likely of low importance or not primary contact numbers (e.g., fax, pager, some automated lines if not fitting other categories).
4.  `confidence` (float): A score from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating your confidence in the extraction.
5.  `context_snippet` (string): A short text snippet (approx. 20-30 words or a sentence) around the number.
6.  `company_name` (string or null): The name of the company associated with the number. Use `null` if not applicable or not found.
7.  `extra_details` (string or null): Any other relevant notes. Use `null` or an empty string if none.

EXAMPLE JSON OUTPUT (should be an array of objects like this):
```json
[
  {
    "original_number_text": "Contact us: (800) CALL-NOW",
    "normalized_number": "+18002255669",
    "category": "Sales",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "context_snippet": "For immediate assistance, Contact us: (800) CALL-NOW. Our representatives are standing by.",
    "company_name": "Best Deals Inc.",
    "extra_details": "CALL-NOW mapped to 225-5669. Assumed US country code."
  },
  {
    "original_number_text": "Tech support line is 555.123.4567",
    "normalized_number": "+15551234567",
    "category": "Support",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "context_snippet": "If you experience issues, our Tech support line is 555.123.4567 available weekdays.",
    "company_name": "Tech Solutions Ltd.",
    "extra_details": "Assumed US country code."
  }
]
```

If no numbers are found, the output MUST be:
```json
[]
```

Do not add any explanations or text before or after the JSON array.
