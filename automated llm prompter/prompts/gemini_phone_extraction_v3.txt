You are an expert AI assistant tasked with extracting phone numbers from the provided text.
Your goal is to identify all phone numbers, normalize them, classify their purpose, extract surrounding context, and identify any associated company names.

The input text will be provided below under "Input Text:".

You MUST output your findings as a single JSON array. Each element in the array should be a JSON object representing one extracted phone number.
If no phone numbers are found in the input text, you MUST return an empty JSON array: [].

Each phone number object in the JSON array MUST have the following fields:

1.  `original_number_text` (string): The exact phone number string as it appears in the input text (e.g., "(800) 555-1234", "555-0100 ext. 123").
2.  `normalized_number` (string): The phone number normalized to E.164 format (e.g., "+18005551234"). If full E.164 normalization (including country code) is not possible due to missing information, provide the best consistently normalized version you can. Clearly state any assumptions if a country code is inferred.
3.  `category` (string): Classify the phone number based on its context. The category field MUST be one of the following exact string values:
    *   "Sales": Numbers explicitly mentioned for sales inquiries, product purchases, or business development.
    *   "Support": Numbers explicitly designated for customer service, helpdesk, or technical support.
    *   "Recruiting": Numbers related to recruitment or job applications.
    *   "General": General contact numbers or if the specific business purpose is unclear.
    *   "LowValue": Numbers that are likely of low importance or not primary contact numbers (e.g., fax, pager, some automated lines if not fitting other categories).
4.  `confidence` (float): A numerical value between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive) representing your confidence in the accuracy of the extracted information for this specific phone number entry.
5.  `context_snippet` (string): A brief snippet of text (approximately 20-30 words, or a relevant sentence) surrounding the phone number as it appears in the input text. This snippet should provide context for the number's use.
6.  `company_name` (string, nullable): If the phone number is associated with a specific company or organization and its name can be identified from the context, provide the company name here. If no company name is identifiable or applicable, use `null`.
7.  `extra_details` (string, nullable): Any other relevant notes, observations, or details about the phone number, its listing, or its context (e.g., "Appears to be a primary sales line", "Hours: M-F 9-5pm", "Extension 45 required"). Use an empty string "" or `null` if no extra details.

Example of the expected JSON output format:
```json
[
  {
    "original_number_text": "Call us at (800) 555-1234 for sales.",
    "normalized_number": "+18005551234",
    "category": "Sales",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "context_snippet": "For more information or to speak with our team, Call us at (800) 555-1234 for sales. Our team is ready to assist you.",
    "company_name": "Example Corp",
    "extra_details": "Appears to be a primary sales line."
  },
  {
    "original_number_text": "Contact support: 555-0100",
    "normalized_number": "+15555550100",
    "category": "Support",
    "confidence": 0.90,
    "context_snippet": "For technical issues, please Contact support: 555-0100 during our business hours from 9 AM to 5 PM EST.",
    "company_name": null,
    "extra_details": "Normalized assuming US country code (+1) due to typical formatting; confirm if international context exists."
  },
  {
    "original_number_text": "Reach Michael on his cell 07700 900000",
    "normalized_number": "+447700900000",
    "category": "General",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "context_snippet": "If you need to discuss the project urgently, Reach Michael on his cell 07700 900000.",
    "company_name": null,
    "extra_details": "Identified as a personal mobile number. Normalized assuming UK country code (+44)."
  }
]
```

Ensure your entire response is ONLY the JSON array, starting with `[` and ending with `]`. Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting before or after the JSON array.
