I have a new task,a colleague of minec used ChatGPT to find companies similar to a dataset of companies. He went on ChatGPT and he found loads of companies that are supposed to be similar, and it's created a bunch of hallucinations, like a bunch of fake numbers. So I have a spreadsheet now, and it's got 4,000 entries around, and he says that the URLs are correct, the actual websites, but the numbers, some of them are not correct. So what I need to do is I need to compare the number to the website, I want you to act like an experienced, meticulously expert data scientist approaching this problem. I want to do this in the best possible way, most efficient and optimized, and I don't mind using new tools if you have good suggestions.
