# Summary of Pipeline Enhancements and Next Steps (2025-05-22_125700)

This document summarizes the recent enhancements implemented in the phone number extraction pipeline and outlines the necessary next steps for verification and debugging.

## 1. Implemented Enhancements

The following key features and improvements have been integrated into the codebase:

### 1.1. LLM Number Mismatch Handling
To address rare instances where the LLM might alter input numbers:
*   **Prompt Refinement**: Instructions in [`prompts/gemini_phone_validation_v1.txt`](prompts/gemini_phone_validation_v1.txt) were made more explicit, emphasizing that the LLM must return the exact input number and maintain item order.
*   **Configurable Retries**:
    *   A new configuration, `llm_max_retries_on_number_mismatch`, was added to [`src/core/config.py`](src/core/config.py:157) (defaulting to 1).
    *   The corresponding environment variable `LLM_MAX_RETRIES_ON_NUMBER_MISMATCH` was added to [`.env.example`](.env.example:75).
*   **Retry Logic**: The `extract_phone_numbers` method in [`src/llm_extractor_component.py`](src/llm_extractor_component.py) was updated to:
    *   Detect mismatches between input numbers and LLM output numbers.
    *   Perform targeted retries for only the mismatched items, up to the configured number of attempts.
    *   Standardize handling for persistently mismatched items.
    *   Accumulate token usage across initial and retry calls.

### 1.2. Enhanced URL Handling and Logging Clarity
To improve robustness when dealing with incomplete URL inputs and to make logs more informative:
*   **Configurable TLD Probing**:
    *   A new configuration, `URL_PROBING_TLDS`, was added to [`src/core/config.py`](src/core/config.py:165) (defaulting to "de,com,at,ch").
    *   The corresponding environment variable `URL_PROBING_TLDS` was added to [`.env.example`](.env.example:142).
*   **TLD Probing Implementation**:
    *   The URL preprocessing logic in [`main_pipeline.py`](main_pipeline.py) (around lines 288-300) was significantly updated.
    *   It now attempts to resolve domain-like inputs lacking a TLD by trying to append TLDs from `URL_PROBING_TLDS` and performing a DNS lookup (using `socket.gethostbyname`) for each attempt.
*   **Improved Logging**:
    *   Logging in [`main_pipeline.py`](main_pipeline.py) around URL transformation was enhanced to provide clearer information on original vs. processed URLs.
    *   Warning messages in the `get_canonical_base_url` function within [`src/data_handler.py`](src/data_handler.py:53-61) were refined to be more context-aware, especially when dealing with raw input URLs during later processing stages.

## 2. Next Steps for Verification and Debugging

Thorough testing is required to ensure these enhancements function as expected and to identify any remaining issues.

### 2.1. Test Enhanced URL Handling (TLD Probing and Logging)
*   **Action**: Run the `main_pipeline.py` with input data that includes:
    *   Company names or domains without TLDs (e.g., 'LEGALPROD' which should ideally resolve to 'legalprod.com' after '.de' fails).
    *   Valid URLs that require no modification.
    *   Schemeless URLs.
*   **Verification**:
    *   Carefully examine the pipeline logs.
    *   Confirm that the TLD probing mechanism attempts DNS lookups for the configured TLDs in order.
    *   Verify that URLs are correctly formed (e.g., `http://legalprod.com`) if a TLD probe is successful.
    *   Check that logging messages accurately reflect the original input, the probing attempts, and the final URL used for scraping.
    *   Ensure that the refined warnings in `src.data_handler.py` are less misleading when processing original, potentially non-URL `GivenURL` values during report generation.

### 2.2. Test LLM Number Mismatch Retry Logic
*   **Action**:
    1.  **Prepare Test Data**: Create a small, dedicated CSV/Excel input file with 2-3 rows. Each row should have a `GivenURL` pointing to a simple, reliable, and easily scrapable webpage known to contain distinct phone numbers.
    2.  **Simulate Mismatch**:
        *   Identify the point in [`src/llm_extractor_component.py`](src/llm_extractor_component.py) within the `extract_phone_numbers` method *after* the initial LLM call and response parsing (i.e., after `validated_numbers_pass1` is populated).
        *   For one or two of your test input items, if the LLM correctly returns the number (e.g., `+49123456`), temporarily insert code to manually alter this specific `llm_output_item.number` in the `validated_numbers_pass1` list to create a mismatch (e.g., change it to `+491234567`).
    3.  **Run Pipeline**: Execute `main_pipeline.py` using this specific test file and the temporary code modification. Set `LLM_MAX_RETRIES_ON_NUMBER_MISMATCH` to 1 or 2 in your `.env` file for testing.
*   **Verification**:
    *   Examine pipeline logs for messages indicating:
        *   The initial number mismatch.
        *   The start of a retry pass for the specific mismatched item(s).
        *   The outcome of the retry attempt (successful correction or persistent mismatch).
    *   Check the final output data to confirm that the number was either corrected or appropriately flagged as an error.
    *   Verify accumulated token counts.
    4.  **Cleanup**: Remember to remove the temporary code modification from [`src/llm_extractor_component.py`](src/llm_extractor_component.py) after testing.
