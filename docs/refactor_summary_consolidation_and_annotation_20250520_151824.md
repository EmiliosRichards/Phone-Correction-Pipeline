# Summary of Refactoring: Enhanced Report Consolidation & Phone Annotation

**Date:** 2025-05-20

This document summarizes the significant enhancements made to the phone validation pipeline, primarily focusing on the `Top_Contacts_Report` and the accuracy of phone number annotations.

## Key Accomplishments:

1.  **`Top_Contacts_Report` Restructuring**:
    *   The `Top_Contacts_Report_{run_id}.xlsx` (internally referred to as the Tertiary Report) is now generated with **one consolidated row per unique true base domain** (e.g., `https://example.com`).
    *   If multiple input company names or URLs map to the same true base domain, their data is intelligently merged into this single row for this specific report.
    *   The `CompanyName` column in this report is formatted as: `[TrueBaseDomain] - OriginalCompanyA - OriginalCompanyB...` (listing all original input companies associated with that domain).
    *   The `GivenURL` column aggregates all original input URLs that map to the true base domain.
    *   The `Description` column has been removed from this report for conciseness.

2.  **Accurate Company Attribution for Phone Numbers (in `Top_Contacts_Report`)**:
    *   Phone numbers listed (e.g., `PhoneNumber_1`) now have appended company names in the format `[Number] (Aggregated Types) [CompanyA, CompanyB]`.
    *   Crucially, this `[CompanyA, CompanyB]` list now accurately reflects *only* those original input companies whose data specifically sourced that particular phone number within the context of the given true base domain.
    *   This was achieved by:
        *   Updating schemas ([`src/core/schemas.py`](src/core/schemas.py:1): `PhoneNumberLLMOutput`, `ConsolidatedPhoneNumberSource`) to include `original_input_company_name`.
        *   Propagating this `original_input_company_name` through the data pipeline:
            *   [`src/regex_extractor_component.py`](src/regex_extractor_component.py:1): `extract_numbers_with_snippets_from_text` now accepts and outputs it.
            *   [`src/llm_extractor_component.py`](src/llm_extractor_component.py:1): Updated to pass the name through to `PhoneNumberLLMOutput`.
            *   [`src/data_handler.py`](src/data_handler.py:1): `process_and_consolidate_contact_data` now stores it in `ConsolidatedPhoneNumberSource`.
        *   Modifying [`main_pipeline.py`](main_pipeline.py:1) to use this detailed information when formatting the `PhoneNumber_X` strings for the `Top_Contacts_Report`.

3.  **Enhanced Phone Number Sorting**:
    *   Phone numbers within all consolidated lists (affecting all reports) are now sorted more effectively.
    *   The primary sort key is the LLM-assigned `classification` (e.g., Primary, Secondary).
    *   A secondary sort key based on phone `type` (e.g., "Main Line" preferred over "Info-Hotline") is used as a tie-breaker if classifications are identical. This logic was implemented in `get_classification_priority` in [`src/data_handler.py`](src/data_handler.py:1).

4.  **Pipeline Internals Refactored (`main_pipeline.py`)**:
    *   **Pass 1 Data Collection**:
        *   Collects raw LLM outputs keyed by the (potentially pathful) canonical URL from the scraper (`canonical_site_raw_llm_outputs`).
        *   The `CanonicalEntryURL` stored in the main DataFrame (`df`) for each input row is now correctly set to the *true base domain*.
    *   **Global Consolidation Step**:
        *   A new step after Pass 1 aggregates all raw LLM outputs that share the same *true base domain*.
        *   `process_and_consolidate_contact_data` is then called *once per true base domain* with all its relevant LLM outputs.
        *   The results are stored in `final_consolidated_data_by_true_base`, and an overall scraper status for each true base domain is stored in `true_base_scraper_status`.
    *   **Report Generation (Pass 2)**:
        *   All three reports (`Top_Contacts_Report`, Detailed Flattened Report, Summary Report) now consistently use data derived from `final_consolidated_data_by_true_base` and `true_base_scraper_status` for lookups and status reporting, ensuring consistency based on true base domains.

5.  **Documentation Updates**:
    *   [`README.md`](README.md:1) and [`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md:1) were updated to reflect the three primary report outputs and the new consolidation strategy, particularly for the `Top_Contacts_Report`.

6.  **Code Cleanup**:
    *   The unused DataFrame column `'AllCompanyContacts'` was removed from initialization in [`main_pipeline.py`](main_pipeline.py:1).

These changes provide a more accurate, clear, and robust system for handling complex company structures and ensuring the `Top_Contacts_Report` is optimized for agent use.
