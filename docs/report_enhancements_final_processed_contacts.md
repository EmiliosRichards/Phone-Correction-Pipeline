# Report Enhancements: Introduction of "Final Processed Contacts"

This document outlines the recent enhancements made to the reporting capabilities of the Phone Correction Pipeline, specifically addressing GitHub Issue #1.

## Summary of Changes

Two main changes were implemented:

1.  **Renaming of the Primary Contacts Report:** The main detailed contacts report, previously generated with a name like `Top_Contacts_Report_{run_id}.xlsx`, has been renamed to **`Final Contacts.xlsx`**. This change provides a clearer and more consistent naming convention. The filename is configured via the `tertiary_report_file_name_template` variable in [`src/core/config.py`](../src/core/config.py).

2.  **Introduction of "Final Processed Contacts.xlsx" Report:** A new, more concise Excel report named **`Final Processed Contacts.xlsx`** has been added. This report is designed to provide a cleaner, more focused view of the contact data.

## Details of "Final Processed Contacts.xlsx"

### Generation Logic
The "Final Processed Contacts.xlsx" report is generated *after* the "Final Contacts.xlsx" report has been created. It uses the "Final Contacts.xlsx" file as its direct data source. This ensures:
*   **Data Consistency:** The "Final Processed Contacts.xlsx" will always have the same number of rows and list the exact same companies as the "Final Contacts.xlsx" report for that specific run.
*   **Integrated Logic:** The transformation logic, originally prototyped in the user-provided `scripts/process_contacts.py` script, has been integrated into the main pipeline within the [`generate_processed_contacts_report`](../src/data_handler.py) function in [`src/data_handler.py`](../src/data_handler.py).

### Report Columns
The "Final Processed Contacts.xlsx" report includes the following columns:

1.  **Company Name:** The name of the company.
2.  **URL:** The canonical base URL of the company.
3.  **Number:** The primary contact phone number.
4.  **Number Type:** The type of the phone number (e.g., "Main Line", "Direct Dial").
5.  **Number Found At:** A comma-separated list of specific URLs where the phone number was found.

### File Location and Formatting
*   **Location:** This new report is saved in the same run-specific output folder as other generated reports (e.g., `outputs/{run_id}/Final_Processed_Contacts.xlsx`). The filename is configured via the `processed_contacts_report_file_name_template` variable in [`src/core/config.py`](../src/core/config.py).
*   **Column Widths:** The column widths in the Excel file are automatically adjusted to fit the content, enhancing readability.

## Redundancy of `scripts/process_contacts.py`
As the logic from `scripts/process_contacts.py` has been incorporated into the automated pipeline, the standalone script is **no longer required** for generating the "Final Processed Contacts.xlsx" report and can be considered for removal from the repository if it serves no other purpose.

These enhancements aim to provide more structured, clear, and useful output from the pipeline.
