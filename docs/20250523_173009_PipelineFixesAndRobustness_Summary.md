# Summary: Pipeline Fixes and Robustness Enhancements - 2025-05-23

This session focused on debugging and resolving critical issues within the phone number extraction pipeline, primarily in [`main_pipeline.py`](main_pipeline.py) and [`src/scraper/scraper_logic.py`](src/scraper/scraper_logic.py). These fixes were essential for the stability and correct operation of the pipeline, including recently integrated features such as TLD domain probing and enhanced error handling.

## Key Issues Addressed:

1.  **Failure Log Handling (`ValueError` in `main_pipeline.py`):**
    *   **Problem**: An `ValueError: I/O operation on closed file` occurred due to the `failure_log_csv_path` file being closed prematurely.
    *   **Resolution**: The file handling for the failure log was restructured using a `try...finally` block encompassing the main processing loop. This ensures the file is opened before processing begins and reliably closed only after all operations are complete or if an unrecoverable error occurs.

2.  **Missing Import (`NameError` in `src/scraper/scraper_logic.py`):**
    *   **Problem**: A `NameError: name 'urlunparse' is not defined` was raised because the `urlunparse` function was used without being imported.
    *   **Resolution**: The necessary import (`from urllib.parse import urlunparse`) was added to [`src/scraper/scraper_logic.py`](src/scraper/scraper_logic.py:1).

3.  **Structural Integrity (`Pylance Error` in `main_pipeline.py`):**
    *   **Problem**: A persistent Pylance error (`Try statement must have at least one except or finally clause`) for the main `try` block starting at line 587 indicated significant structural issues. This was caused by incorrect indentation of multiple code blocks within this large `try` block, leading to its premature termination before the `finally` clause at line 1722.
    *   **Resolution**: Through several iterative steps, the indentation of various code segments between lines 588 and 1721 was meticulously corrected. This ensured that all report generation logic and other operations were properly nested within the main `try` block, allowing the `finally` clause to be correctly associated.

## Outcome:

These debugging efforts have significantly improved the robustness and reliability of the pipeline. The correction of file handling, import errors, and major structural indentation issues ensures that the pipeline executes as intended and that error logging mechanisms function correctly, supporting the overall goal of accurate phone number extraction with enhanced URL processing capabilities.
