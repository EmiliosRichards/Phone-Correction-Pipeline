# Summary: Feature Updates & Critical Bug Fixes - 2025-05-23

This session focused on implementing significant new features to enhance the phone number extraction pipeline's efficiency and robustness, alongside resolving critical bugs that impacted stability and core functionality.

## New Features Implemented:

### 1. LLM Input Chunking
To better manage API calls and processing for URLs with numerous potential phone number candidates, the following logic was introduced in [`src/llm_extractor_component.py`](src/llm_extractor_component.py):
-   **Chunked Processing**: Regex candidates sent to the LLM are now processed in smaller, configurable chunks (default: 10 candidates per chunk).
-   **Processing Limits**: A configurable maximum number of chunks (default: 10 chunks) is processed per canonical URL, preventing excessive LLM calls for very dense sites.
-   **Configuration**: These limits are controllable via new environment variables `LLM_CANDIDATE_CHUNK_SIZE` and `LLM_MAX_CHUNKS_PER_URL`, integrated into [`src/core/config.py`](src/core/config.py) and documented in [`.env.example`](.env.example).
-   **Contextual Logging**: LLM context files are now saved with chunk identifiers for easier debugging.

### 2. DNS Error Fallback Strategies
To improve scraping success rates when initial URL attempts fail due to DNS resolution issues, new fallback mechanisms were added to [`src/scraper/scraper_logic.py`](src/scraper/scraper_logic.py):
-   **Hyphenated Domain Simplification**: If a domain like `company-event.de` fails with a DNS error, the scraper will attempt to simplify it by trying `company.de`.
-   **TLD Swap (.de to .com)**: If a `.de` domain (either the original or a hyphen-simplified version) fails with a DNS error, the scraper will attempt to use a `.com` TLD instead (e.g., `example.de` becomes `example.com`).
-   **Control**: This feature is enabled by default and can be controlled via the `ENABLE_DNS_ERROR_FALLBACKS` setting in [`src/core/config.py`](src/core/config.py) and [`.env.example`](.env.example).
-   **Refactoring**: The `scrape_website` function was refactored to manage a queue of URL candidates for these fallback attempts.

## Critical Bug Fixes & Stability Enhancements:

Throughout the implementation and testing of these features, several underlying issues were identified and resolved:

-   **Failure Log Integrity (`ValueError` in `main_pipeline.py`):** Corrected the handling of the `failure_log.csv` file by ensuring its file writer remains open throughout all processing stages within the main `try` block and is closed reliably in the `finally` clause. This prevents `ValueError: I/O operation on closed file`.
-   **URL Construction (`NameError` in `src/scraper/scraper_logic.py`):** Ensured `urlunparse` from `urllib.parse` was correctly imported in [`src/scraper/scraper_logic.py`](src/scraper/scraper_logic.py). This was critical for the new DNS fallback logic that constructs alternative URLs.
-   **Pipeline Structural Integrity (Pylance Errors in `main_pipeline.py`):** Addressed and resolved complex and persistent indentation errors within the main `try...finally` block (lines 587-1722) in [`main_pipeline.py`](main_pipeline.py). This involved meticulous correction of multiple nested code blocks to ensure Python's structural rules were met, thereby clearing Pylance errors and guaranteeing the intended exception handling flow.

## Outcome:
The pipeline is now more robust, with enhanced capabilities for handling large candidate lists for LLM processing and more resilience in scraping URLs prone to DNS issues. Critical bugs affecting file I/O and code structure have been fixed, leading to a more stable and reliable system.
